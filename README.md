# SAGE3 GraphGenerator
 The purpose of this project is to formulate a creative way to handle data sheets. One thing that Luc Renambot suggested was to “Imagine you get a new dataset that you don't know anything about and want to make some graph”. In other words, this project will be me figuring out how to dynamically create graphs depending on the data set.
